        <p>Hello, this is some of the stuff I keep on the Internet. Here you can find almost everything about me, things I've done, things I'm doing, things I want to do and things I'm really obsessed with.</p>

    <section id="about">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>I'm a simple writer - yes, that's a thing. I just write, and my North Star is clarity of thought.</li>
            <li>I've been lucky enough to work with some amazing folks since I started out, including <a href="https://x.com/AyushkWadhwa">Ayush Wadhwa</a>, <a href="https://x.com/paraschopra">Paras Chopra</a>, <a href="https://x.com/Saxenasaheb">Saumya Saxena</a>, and so many more founders I really admire.</li>
            <li>Speaking of numbers, I've done millions of impressions across platforms and content types, whether <a href="https://www.instagram.com/builders.central/">reels</a>, <a href="https://x.com/tushaarmehtaa/status/1765270035721822483">tweets</a>, or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/karthiksridharan1_startup-activity-7212686224094810112-fMZP?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop">posts</a>.</li>
            <li>Currently, I am playing around with Generative AI (not the whole AI - not that technical at the moment) - have been working on a couple of ideas.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <div class="project">
            <h3><a href="https://jimbro.framer.ai/">JimBro</a></h3>
            <p>Name sounds funny, but I'm trying to make it easier than ever to log workouts using voice and AI.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="project">
            <h3>Internal tools-as-a-service</h3>
            <p>Think dashboard, think smallest GPT wrappers that allow most mundane tasks to be handled by technology rather than humans, built for internal corporate use.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="project">
            <h3><a href="https://x.com/podcastdecoded_">Podcast Decoded</a></h3>
            <p>Did this with my brother a while back - where we listened to podcasts and shared notes - so you don't have to.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="project">
            <h3><a href="https://x.com/FlowwMedia">Floww Media</a></h3>
            <p>Did this with two of my brothers - to make exceptional thumbnails for YouTubers - got some clients from India, Korea and the States - couldn't keep up with a job.</p>

        <h2>Writings</h2>
        <div class="writing">
            <h3><a href="https://tushaarmehtaa.bearblog.dev/your-day-job/">Your Day Job is Useless</a></h3>
            <p>"I'm just doing this to learn, then I'm going to start my own thing." If I had a dollar for every time I heard that, I'd never need to work again.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="writing">
            <h3><a href="https://tushaarmehtaa.bearblog.dev/making-great-things/">Make Laziness Enablers</a></h3>
            <p>I'm obsessed with laziness right now. Not my own (though my family might disagree). I'm talking about your laziness. The user's laziness.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="writing">
            <h3><a href="https://tushaarmehtaa.bearblog.dev/people-on-twitter/">People on Twitter</a></h3>
            <p>People on Twitter. They don't appreciate actionable advice. They don't value the small, daily steps they can take to reach their goals. Why? Because that takes effort.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="writing">
            <h3><a href="https://tushaarmehtaa.bearblog.dev/specialization-is-overrated/">Specialization is overrated</a></h3>
            <p>"Specialization is for insects." When I first read this quote by Naval 3 years back, it really resonated with me. And I thought, why not?</p>
